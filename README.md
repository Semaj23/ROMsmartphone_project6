## Detailed Dashboard Insights

### 1. Count of Models per Selling Platform
**Observation:**  
- Walmart leads with 260 models, closely followed by AliExpress (258) and Official Stores (256).
- Best Buy features the fewest models (234), suggesting a more curated inventory.

**Recommendation:**  
- Brands should ensure strong representation on Walmart and AliExpress due to their broader reach.
- Platforms with lower model diversity (e.g., Best Buy) can focus on premium or high-rated models.


### 2. Average Rating per Brand
**Observation:**  
- Apple (4.04), Google (4.00), and Realme (4.01) lead in user satisfaction.
- OnePlus (3.93) and Nokia (3.93) lag in customer ratings.

**Recommendation:**  
- Lower-rated brands should prioritize customer feedback loops and after-sale service improvements.
- Marketing for top-rated brands should emphasize satisfaction scores as a trust-building element.


### 3. Top 5 Most Expensive Phones
**Observation:**  
- Redmi Note SE 14 and Pixel Plus 12 top the list at $1,999.

- Most phones cluster around 90 Hz (417 models) and 120 Hz (401 models).
- Fewer models support high-end refresh rates (144/165 Hz).
